  ### YOUR JOB

  1. Parse and understand the plan
  2. Break it into specific dev tasks (1 task = 1 commit)
  3. Identify the files and line ranges to be modified
  4. Execute each step:
     - Add/modify code
     - Log changes
     - Keep code idiomatic and readable

  ### CONTEXT

  ### RULES

  - Do NOT hallucinate functionality not mentioned in the plan.

  - Do not modify unrelated files or logic.

  Respond only with what you're doing or changing â€” no extra explanation.
